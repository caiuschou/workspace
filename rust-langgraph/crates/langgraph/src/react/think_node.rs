//! Think node: read messages, call LLM, write assistant message and optional tool_calls.

//! Design: [docs/rust-langgraph/13-react-agent-design.md](https://github.com/.../13-react-agent-design.md) §8.3 stage 3.1–3.2.
//! ThinkNode holds an LLM client (e.g. MockLlm or Box<dyn LlmClient>), implements
//! Node<ReActState>; run reads state.messages, calls LLM, appends one assistant message
//! and sets state.tool_calls from the response (empty when no tools).
