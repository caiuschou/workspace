//! Graph node trait: one step in a StateGraph.
//!
//! Receives state `S`, returns updated `S` and `Next` (continue, jump, or end).
//! Used by `StateGraph` and `CompiledStateGraph`. Aligns with LangGraph node
//! `(state) -> partial`. Agents can implement `Node<S>` when `Agent::State == S`.
//! Conditional edges: see `Next` and 13-react-agent-design §8.5.
